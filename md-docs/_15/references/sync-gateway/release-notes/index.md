## New Features

- **Shared bucket access**
- **SSL and Multi-URL support**

## Notable Changes

- **Revs Limit lower limit:** The [databases.foo\_db.revs\_limit](../../../guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html#1.5/databases-foo_db-revs_limit) property now has a minimum value. See the API reference for more detail.
- **Rev Tree endpoint:** The [/{db}/\_revtree/{doc}](../admin-rest-api/index.html?v=1.5#/document/get__db___revtree__doc_) endpoint returns the revision tree in dot syntax for the specified document. This endpoint is not officially supported and should only be used for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
