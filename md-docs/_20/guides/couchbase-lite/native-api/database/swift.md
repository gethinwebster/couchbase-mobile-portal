## New Database

As the top-level entity in the API, new databases can be created using the `Database` class by passing in a name, configuration, or both. The following example creates a database using the `Database(name: String)` method.

```swift
do {
  let database = try Database(name: "my-database")
} catch {
  print(error)
}
```

Just as before, the database will be created in a default location. Alternatively, the `Database(name: Strings, config: DatabaseConfiguration?)` method can be used to provide specific options (the directory to create the database in, encryption key, etc.)

## Migrating from 1.x Databases

Databases that were created with Couchbase Mobile 1.2 or later can be read using the 2.0 API. Upon detecting it is a 1.x database file format, Couchbase Lite will automatically upgrade it to the new format used in 2.0. This feature is currently only available for the default storage type, SQLite (i.e not for ForestDB databases).

## Finding a Database File

When the application is running on the iOS simulator, you can easily locate the application's sandbox directory using the [SimPholders](https://simpholders.com/3/) utility.

## CLI tool

The Couchbase Lite `.zip` file available from the [downloads page](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads) contains a CLI which can be used on **.cblite2** files.

## Logging

The log messages are split into different domains (`LogDomains`) which can be tuned to different log levels. The following example enables `verbose` logging for the `replicator` and `query` domains.

```swift
Database.setLogLevel(.verbose, domain: .replicator)
Database.setLogLevel(.verbose, domain: .query)
```

## Singleton Pattern

The database instance must be used throughout the Couchbase Lite API to Create, Update, Delete and Query documents. Hence, the singleton pattern is useful to create a single instance of the `Database` object. The following example follows the Singleton Pattern in `Swift`.

```swift
class DataManager {
  static let sharedInstance: DataManager = DataManager()
	
  private init() {
    do {
  	  self.database = try Database(name: "dbname")
    } catch {
  	  fatalError("Could not initialize database")
    }
  }
}
```

The database instance can then be access throughout the codebase using the class property: `DataManager.sharedInstance.database`.

##  Database Configuration

[//]: # (TODO: add content about encryption: algorithm, security level...)

The [`DatabaseConfiguration`](http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-swift/db021/Structs/DatabaseConfiguration.html) object can be used to provide different options during the database creation. The following example demonstrates how to create a database with an encryption key (or open an existing one).

```swift
var dbConfig = DatabaseConfiguration()
dbConfig.encryptionKey = EncryptionKey.password("secretpassword")
self.database = try Database(name: "my-database", config: dbConfig)
```
